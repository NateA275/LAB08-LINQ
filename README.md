# LAB08-LINQ

<!-- Here are the requirements for a valid readme: 

A README is a module consumer’s first – and maybe only – look into your creation. 
The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what
need your module fills, and how effectively it does so. 
Your job is to

tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
show them how they use it (Step by step directions, “Happy Path” walk through)
tell them any other relevant details 
This is your job. It’s up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem 
in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers’ eyes will find their way to your 
README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work. -->
